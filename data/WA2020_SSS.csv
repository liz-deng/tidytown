ABOUT THIS WORKBOOK
This Excel file contains the Self-Sufficiency Standards for all counties and all family types in the state. 
Note that there are several sheets of data. 

The “By County” tab is an easy way to look at results at a Town level for a variety of family types. 

The “By Family” tab is set up for data analysis and loading into databases. Use the Filter function to select data by family type or just specific counties.

The Family Type column uses the the following naming convention:
"a#i#p#s#t# where a=adult, i=infant, p=preschooler, s=school-age, t=teenager"

"For example, if you want to see results for a household with 2 adults, 1 preschooler, 1 school-age child in Example County:"

1. Select the “Filter” function
2. Click on the Family Type column header
3. In the search box enter “a2i0p1s1t0”
4. Click the County column header
5. In the search box enter “Example”

"The results will then be filtered for Example County for 2 adults, 1 preschooler, 1 school-age child."

"The ""SSS"" tab provides only annual Self-Sufficiency Standards."
"The ""SSW"" tab provides only hourly Self-Sufficieny Standard wages (assumes full time, year round work)"
